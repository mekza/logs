## Why Berlin?

I'm germany-inclined since I know my mother was born in _Westdeutschland_ (aka BRD). For the records, my grand-father (RIP) was a member of the TOA (Troupes d’occupation en Allemagne, in english: Occupation troops in Germany).

My first trip in Berlin was 10 or 11 years ago with my classmates and teachers. We had a typical sightseeing tour:

* Tiergarten
* Brandenburger Tör
* Filmstudio Babelsberg
* Sanssouci
* Kurfürstendamm
* Potsdamer Platz
* Charlie Checkpoint
* Museumsinsel
* etc...

Now, let's leave the past where it is and speak about the present. 

I have many friends in Berlin [@paraboul](http://twitter.com/paraboul), [@psish](http://twitter.com/psish), [@un_geek](http://twitter.com/un_geek), and more. 

I came back to Berlin on December 3rd, 2011., I needed a break with cold-and-boring Paris so I took a cheap round-trip ticket on Easyjet's website just for 3 days. After a 1hr flight I took a cab to go to Friedrichshain the place where my brü live. FYI, between December 2011 and January 2013, I went to Berlin 11 times.


## Friedrichshain

Friedrichshain is a part of Berlin located in the East side, you can live there like a Berliner and for me the best place for newbies. I spent my time in bars, clubs, bars, clubs, bed, clubs, bars (infinite loop).


[@paraboul](http://twitter.com/paraboul), [@psish](http://twitter.com/psish) and [@un_geek](http://twitter.com/un_geek) rent a huge flat (170m2) in Boxhagener Platz near from _Simon-Dach Straße_ aka street of vice (~~too~~ many bars, restaurants, dorüm, night shops, etc.). There are also near from Berghain, Renate, Kater Holtzig, and all famous clubs in Berlin.

## Mitte

In german, Mitte means _the middle_ obviously this is the center of Berlin. In this district you can visit Rothaus, Brandenburger Tör, Unter des Linden ("under the linden trees"), Alexanderplatz and Fernsehturm (picture).

## Kreuzberg

Kreuzberg is like Friedrichshain. Many clubs, restaurants, etc. I made a foursquare's [list](https://foursquare.com/martinzack/list/berlin).
